# Catmull-ROM-Spline-OpenGL-
 Catmull-Rom Spline: The interpolation is based on four points (p0, p1, p2, p3), where the resulting curve goes through p1 and p2.
 This is a basic implementation to visualize the spline. You can expand this by loading control points from a file or adjusting the rendering options.
